# GoreeCloud Code

GoreeCloud Code is the first-party GoreeCloud developer and source-control platform for repositories, collaboration, CI/CD, packages, security, AI-assisted development, and GoreeCloud platform integrations.

Forgejo is the preferred initial, replaceable infrastructure foundation. It is not the permanent GoreeCloud product boundary. GoreeCloud Code owns the user experience, service contracts, governance model, integration architecture, and long-term developer platform.

## Status

**Milestone 1 — Forgejo Connectivity (in progress), with the first Milestone 2 governed write boundary under development**

Milestone 0 established the product boundary, provider abstraction, Forgejo adapter, web application shell, shared contracts, CI foundation, and deployment scaffolding. M1 now includes the runnable GoreeCloud-owned API service, live Glaze UI repository dashboard, provider-neutral repository activity reads, and an end-to-end Forgejo validation stack.

Current M1 capabilities include provider health/version reporting, repository discovery and detail retrieval, branches, commits, issues, and pull-request reads. A real-instance validation run is still required before M1 is complete. The first M2 slice adds provider-neutral branch creation behind explicit server-side write authorization; it does not mark M1 or M2 complete.

## Architecture

The runtime boundary is intentionally replaceable:

            │

            ├── GitHubProvider       migration/interoperability
            └── NativeProvider       future GoreeCloud implementation
```

The browser must not receive Forgejo credentials or depend directly on Forgejo-specific APIs.

## Local connectivity

Configure the GoreeCloud Code API using `.env.example`. At minimum, provide `FORGEJO_BASE_URL`. Private repository discovery requires a narrowly scoped `FORGEJO_TOKEN`; anonymous public discovery can use `FORGEJO_USERNAME` when supported by the instance.

The provider-neutral API includes:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/v1/provider`
- `GET /api/v1/repositories`
- `GET /api/v1/repositories/:owner/:name`
- repository branches, commits, issues, and pull-request read endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/repositories/:owner/:name/branches` for the first bounded write operation

Branch creation requires an explicit `name` and `sourceRef`, a Forgejo provider token, and application-level bearer authorization configured through `GOREECLOUD_CODE_WRITE_TOKEN_FILE`. If the write-authorization secret file is not configured, write routes fail closed. The write bearer token is a development authorization boundary, not the final GoreeCloud Identity/session design.

For an isolated M1 test environment, use `deploy/forgejo/compose.yml` with `deploy/forgejo/.env.example`. This brings up Forgejo and PostgreSQL for local validation; it is not the production deployment architecture.

Once Forgejo and the GoreeCloud Code API are running, validate the provider boundary with:

```sh
FORGEJO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
GOREECLOUD_CODE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787 \
VALIDATE_REPOSITORY=owner/repository \
pnpm validate:forgejo
```

See `docs/architecture/m1-forgejo-connectivity.md` for the full validation gate. M1 must not be marked complete until a real test run is recorded.

## Platform integrations

GoreeCloud Code is designed to integrate with substantive GoreeCloud platform systems as implementations become available:

- **Glaze UI** — developer experience and interaction system.
- **GoreeCloud AI** — governed AI-assisted software development.
- **Wardveil Security** — evidence-backed repository, runner, dependency, artifact, and deployment security state.
- **Privacy Shield** — privacy-control contracts, data minimization, retention, and telemetry governance.
- **Everkeep** — backup, recovery, preservation, portability, and succession.
- **GoreeCloud Mesh** — coordination and governance between first-party applications and services.

Public claims about these systems must remain tied to implemented capabilities and available evidence.

## Development principles

1. Standard Git remains the repository interoperability foundation.
2. Forgejo is replaceable infrastructure, not the permanent product boundary.
3. GoreeCloud-owned APIs and contracts must not expose unnecessary Forgejo-specific assumptions.
4. CI logic should remain portable between GitHub Actions, Forgejo Actions, and future GoreeCloud Pipelines.
5. Security-sensitive capabilities require least privilege, explicit authorization, and evidence-backed controls.
6. Repository migration must preserve Git history and deliberately account for metadata outside Git itself.

## Initial roadmap

### M0 — Bootstrap

Complete foundation: monorepo, provider contracts, Forgejo adapter, web shell, API boundary, CI, and architecture decisions.

### M1 — Forgejo connectivity

In progress: real-instance authentication and validation, repository discovery/detail, branches, commits, issues, pull requests, provider health, live web dashboard, and end-to-end validation tooling.

### M2 — Governed write operations

Started: provider-neutral branch creation with explicit ref validation, server-side authorization, and Forgejo credential isolation. Issue mutation, pull-request creation, review workflows, GoreeCloud Identity-backed authorization, audit/evidence integration, and bounded GoreeCloud AI operations remain planned.

### M3 — Pipelines, packages, and migration

Planned: portable workflow execution, GoreeCloud-controlled runners, package/OCI registry integration, GitHub import tooling, and external repository mirroring.
